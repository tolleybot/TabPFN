    !!! note

        This function may infer particular columns to not be categorical
        as defined by what suits the model predictions and it's pre-training.

    Every temporal column has already been resolved (expanded into calendar
    features, or rendered to text) by `DateFeatureExpander` before this ever
    runs, so there is nothing here that ever learns a column was a date.

    Args:
        X: The data to infer feature modalities from.
        feature_names: The names of the features.
        provided_categorical_indices: User-provided indices considered categorical.
        provided_numerical_indices: Indices already known to be numerical --
            e.g. calendar features `DateFeatureExpander` produced -- tagged
            `NUMERICAL` outright rather than run through the cardinality
            heuristic, which would otherwise risk miscategorizing a
            low-cardinality one (e.g. a `year` spanning few distinct values)
            as `CATEGORICAL`.
        provided_date_text_indices: Indices `DateFeatureExpander` already
            warned about by name (a date rendered to text, not expanded);
            excluded from the free-text warning below so the same column is
            never reported by both.
        min_samples_for_inference: Minimum samples required to auto-infer a
            feature not provided as categorical.
        max_unique_for_category: Max unique values for a feature to be categorical.
        min_unique_for_numerical: Min unique values for a feature to be numerical.
        min_cardinality_for_text: Unique-value count above which a candidate
            string column (not parsed as a number) is `TEXT` rather than
            `CATEGORICAL` -- independent of the two thresholds above.
