    even be assembled into the array the rest of the pipeline works on. Alone it

    a number. Rendering also costs less than boxing (0.03s against 0.07s for

    The real value survives too, untouched, in the third return: date
    expansion (`date_encoding.py`) needs the actual point in time, not a
    re-parse of the text this function renders for validation's sake -- text
    rendering and value preservation serve two different, unrelated readers.
