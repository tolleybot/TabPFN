"""Resolve every temporal column before validation ever sees it.

sklearn's array machinery cannot hold a `datetime64` column beside a numeric
one in one array (`DTypePromotionError`: no common dtype exists), so a
temporal column has to stop looking like one before `check_array`/`check_X_y`
run. `resolve_date_columns` is where that happens: a point in time
(`datetime64`, tz-aware, or `period`) is either expanded into calendar
features via `skrub.DatetimeEncoder` (when `TRANSFORM_DATES` is on and the
column isn't declared categorical) or rendered to ISO 8601 text (otherwise,
so it reads as an ordinary high-cardinality category downstream). A duration
(`timedelta64`) always becomes its length in seconds -- a quantity with no
calendar in it, so the number is the whole of its meaning, independent of
`TRANSFORM_DATES`.

Because this runs before validation, there is no `FeatureSchema` yet:
`detect_feature_modalities` only ever sees the *result* -- a fully validated,
already-expanded array -- and never learns a column was ever a date at all.
