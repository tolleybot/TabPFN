        """Construct a TabPFN regressor.

        This constructs a regressor using the latest model and settings. If you would
        like to use a previous model version, use `create_default_for_version()`
        instead. You can also use `model_path` to specify a particular model.

        Args:
            n_estimators:
                The number of estimators in the TabPFN ensemble. We aggregate the
                predictions of `n_estimators`-many forward passes of TabPFN.
                Each forward pass has (slightly) different input data. Think of this
                as an ensemble of `n_estimators`-many "prompts" of the input data.
                With the default `"auto"`, this is `DEFAULT_N_ESTIMATORS`, raised
                on wide datasets so every feature is seen by some estimator (i.e.
                when the data has more than `max_features_per_estimator` features
                per estimator), to the smallest value that lets every feature
                appear in at least one ensemble member, emitting a warning when it
                does so. That auto-scaled value is capped at
                `MAX_AUTO_SCALED_N_ESTIMATORS`; beyond that some features may never
                be sampled unless you raise `n_estimators` yourself. An explicit
                integer is never overridden — if it is too small to cover every
                feature, a warning is emitted at fit time and the value is used
                as given.

            auto_scale_n_estimators:
                Deprecated, removed in v9 — pass an explicit `n_estimators`
                instead. Only applies when `n_estimators="auto"`, where `False`
                keeps the auto value at `DEFAULT_N_ESTIMATORS` rather than raising
                it for feature coverage, exactly what passing
                `n_estimators=DEFAULT_N_ESTIMATORS` does. Passing `False` emits a
                `FutureWarning` at fit time.

            categorical_features_indices:
                The indices of the columns that are suggested to be treated as
                categorical. If `None`, the model will infer the categorical columns.
                If provided, we might ignore some of the suggestion to better fit the
                data seen during pre-training.

                !!! note
                    The indices are 0-based and should represent the data passed to
                    `.fit()`. If the data changes between the initializations of the
                    model and the `.fit()`, consider setting the
                    `.categorical_features_indices` attribute after the model was
                    initialized and before `.fit()`.

            softmax_temperature:
                The temperature for the softmax function. This is used to control the
                confidence of the model's predictions. Lower values make the model's
                predictions more confident. This is only applied when predicting during
                a post-processing step. Set `softmax_temperature=1.0` for no effect.

            average_before_softmax:
                Only used if `n_estimators > 1`. Whether to average the predictions of
                the estimators before applying the softmax function. This can help to
                improve predictive performance when there are many classes or when
                calibrating the model's confidence. This is only applied when
                predicting during a post-processing.

                - If `True`, the predictions are averaged before applying the softmax
                  function. Thus, we average the logits of TabPFN and then apply the
                  softmax.
                - If `False`, the softmax function is applied to each set of logits.
                  Then, we average the resulting probabilities of each forward pass.

            model_path:
                The path to the TabPFN model file, i.e., the pre-trained weights.

                - If `"auto"`, the model will be downloaded upon first use. This
                  defaults to your system cache directory, but can be overwritten
                  with the use of an environment variable `TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR`.
                - If a path or a string of a path, the model will be loaded from
                  the user-specified location if available, otherwise it will be
                  downloaded to this location. Details on available checkpoints are
                  available in the repository README.

            device:
                The device(s) to use for inference.
                See the documentation of `.to()`.

            ignore_pretraining_limits:
                Whether to ignore the pre-training limits of the model. The TabPFN
                models have been pre-trained on a specific range of input data. If the
                input data is outside of this range, the model may not perform well.
                You may ignore our limits to use the model on data outside the
                pre-training range.

                - If `True`, the model will not raise an error if the input data is
                  outside the pre-training range. Also suppresses error when using
                  the model with a large dataset on CPU.
                - If `False`, you can use the model outside the pre-training range, but
                  the model could perform worse.

                !!! note

                    For version 2.5, the pre-training limits are:

                    - 50_000 samples/rows
                    - 2_000 features/columns (Note that for more than 500 features we
                        subsample 500 features per estimator. It is therefore important
                        to use a sufficiently large number of `n_estimators`.)

            device:
                The device to use for inference with TabPFN. If `"auto"`, the device is
                `"cuda"` if available, otherwise `"cpu"`.

                See PyTorch's documentation on devices for more information about
                supported devices.

            inference_precision:
                The precision to use for inference. This can dramatically affect the
                speed and reproducibility of the inference. Higher precision can lead to
                better reproducibility but at the cost of speed. By default, we optimize
                for speed and use torch's mixed-precision autocast. The options are:

                - If `torch.dtype`, we force precision of the model and data to be
                  the specified torch.dtype during inference. This can is particularly
                  useful for reproducibility. Here, we do not use mixed-precision.
                - If `"autocast"`, enable PyTorch's mixed-precision autocast. Ensure
                  that your device is compatible with mixed-precision.
                - If `"auto"`, we determine whether to use autocast or not depending on
                  the device type.

            fit_mode:
                Determine how the TabPFN model is "fitted". The mode determines how the
                data is preprocessed and cached for inference. This is unique to an
                in-context learning foundation model like TabPFN, as the "fitting" is
                technically the forward pass of the model. The options are:

                - If `"low_memory"`, the data is preprocessed on-demand during inference
                  when calling `.predict()` or `.predict_proba()`. This is the most
                  memory-efficient mode but can be slower for large datasets because
                  the data is (repeatedly) preprocessed on-the-fly.
                  Ideal with low GPU memory and/or a single call to `.fit()` and
                  `.predict()`.
                - If `"fit_preprocessors"`, the data is preprocessed and cached once
                  during the `.fit()` call. During inference, the cached preprocessing
                  (of the training data) is used instead of re-computing it.
                  Ideal with low GPU memory and multiple calls to `.predict()` with
                  the same training data.
                - If `"fit_with_cache"`, the data is preprocessed and cached once during
                  the `.fit()` call like in `fit_preprocessors`. Moreover, the
                  transformer key-value cache is also initialized, allowing for much
                  faster inference on the same data at a large cost of memory.
                  Ideal with very high GPU memory and multiple calls to `.predict()`
                  with the same training data.
                - If `"batched"`, the already pre-processed data is iterated over in
                  batches. This can only be done after the data has been preprocessed
                  with the get_preprocessed_datasets function. This is primarily used
                  only for inference with the InferenceEngineBatchedNoPreprocessing
                  class in Fine-Tuning. The fit_from_preprocessed() function sets this
                  attribute internally.

            memory_saving_mode:
                Enable GPU/CPU memory saving mode. This can both avoid out-of-memory
                errors and improve fit+predict speed by reducing memory pressure.

                It saves memory by automatically batching certain model computations
                within TabPFN.

                - If "auto": memory saving mode is enabled/disabled automatically based
                    on a heuristic
                - If True/False: memory saving mode is forced enabled/disabled.

                If speed is important to your application, you may wish to manually tune
                this option by comparing the time taken for fit+predict with it set to
                False and True.

                !!! warning
                    This does not batch the original input data. We still recommend to
                    batch the test set as necessary if you run out of memory.

            keep_cache_on_device:
                Only relevant when `fit_mode="fit_with_cache"`. If True
                (default), the key-value cache is kept on the inference
                device (e.g. GPU). Uses more device
                memory but gives lower latency. If False, the cache is stored on CPU.

            kv_cache_precision:
                Only relevant when `fit_mode="fit_with_cache"`. Resolved against
                what the model architecture supports. `None` (default) picks the
                architecture default (`"int8"` when it can quantize, e.g. TabPFN-3,
                else `"auto"`); `"int8"` quantizes the key-value cache to save
                memory; `"fp8"` stores it as 8-bit floats instead (same size,
                float rounding semantics; not supported on MPS);
                `"auto"` keeps the computed dtype. Requesting a
                quantized precision on an architecture that cannot quantize
                warns and falls back to `"auto"`.

            random_state:
                Controls the randomness of the model. Pass an int for reproducible
                results and see the scikit-learn glossary for more information.
                If `None`, the randomness is determined by the system when calling
                `.fit()`.

                !!! warning
                    We depart from the usual scikit-learn behavior in that by default
                    we provide a fixed seed of `0`.

                !!! note
                    Even if a seed is passed, we cannot always guarantee reproducibility
                    due to PyTorch's non-deterministic operations and general numerical
                    instability. To get the most reproducible results across hardware,
                    we recommend using a higher precision as well (at the cost of a
                    much higher inference time). Likewise, for scikit-learn, consider
                    passing `USE_SKLEARN_16_DECIMAL_PRECISION=True` as kwarg.

            n_jobs:
                Deprecated, use `n_preprocessing_jobs` instead.
                This parameter never had any effect.

            n_preprocessing_jobs:
                The number of worker processes to use for the preprocessing.

                If `1`, the preprocessing will be performed in the current process,
                parallelised across multiple CPU cores. If `>1` and `n_estimators > 1`,
                then different estimators will be dispatched to different processes.

                We strongly recommend setting this to 1, which has the lowest overhead
                and can often fully utilise the CPU. Values >1 can help if you have lots
                of CPU cores available, but can also be slower.

            inference_config:
                For advanced users, additional advanced arguments that adjust the
                behavior of the model interface.
                See [tabpfn.inference_config.InferenceConfig][] for details and options.

                - If `None`, the default InferenceConfig is used.
                - If `dict`, the key-value pairs are used to update the default
                  `InferenceConfig`. Raises an error if an unknown key is passed.
                - If `InferenceConfig`, the object is used as the configuration.

            differentiable_input:
                If true, preprocessing attempts to be end-to-end differentiable.
                Less relevant for standard regression fine-tuning compared to
                prompt-tuning.

            eval_metric:
                Metric by which predictions will be evaluated on test data for
                temperature calibration.
                For currently supported metrics, see
                [tabpfn.inference_tuning.RegressorEvalMetrics][].

            tuning_config:
                The settings to use to tune the model's predictions for the specified
                `eval_metric`. See
                [tabpfn.inference_tuning.RegressorTuningConfig][] for details
